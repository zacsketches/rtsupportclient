# This fork has includes interim updates
This fork of knowthen's code includes a branch named `After_section-3` which provides a working codebase at the end of setion 3, or rather at the completion of the frontend in React.  There are some things not covered in the videos that I found confusing coming to React without much previous experience were:

* Getting the Channel name to switch in the Messages component
* Adding the activeChannel to the app.state
* Updating the activeChannel.Id and activeChannel.name in the setChannel method
